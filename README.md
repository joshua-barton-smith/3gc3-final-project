# CS 3GC3 Final Project - Scavenger Hunt Game

## Overview of project

- Project is a game in which one of many 3d scenes is provided to the user, along with some hints (possibly images, directional indicators, etc) as to what items they need to find in the scene.
- The game is played from a first person perspective and the user will need to actively search through the scene to find objects.
- Game will contain a full-featured first person camera, lighting, 3d models, textures, animations, etc. to make it more interesting to play.
- A timer or scoring system will also be implemented to make the game contain some failure states.
